# Area-Prediction
The task is to predict the area of a national park burned in a forest fire based on the Fire Weather Index data. 

It is a regression task. The following models have been used: 
1. Non-optimized decision tree
2. Optimized decision tree (after hyperparameter tuning)
3. Ridge regression

The jupyter notebook also contains details about the normalization of the features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
